# FLEXT-LDIF Development Roadmap

**Version**: 0.9.0 | **Updated**: September 17, 2025

## 🎯 Current Status

### What Actually Works (v0.9.0)

- **LDIF Processing**: Basic RFC 2849 compliant parsing and writing
- **Service Architecture**: Five services (parser, validator, writer, repository, analytics) with unified API
- **Type Safety**: Complete Python 3.13+ type annotations with Pydantic v2 models
- **Error Handling**: FlextResult patterns throughout with railway-oriented programming
- **FLEXT Integration**: Uses flext-core patterns (FlextContainer, FlextLogger)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with good coverage

### Current Limitations

- **Memory Usage**: Loads entire LDIF files into memory during processing
- **Performance**: Single-threaded processing suitable for small to medium files
- **Scale**: Recommended for files under 100MB due to memory constraints
- **Features**: Basic functionality focused on parsing and validation

## 🔧 Technical Debt and Quality Issues

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Some mypy errors need resolution
- **Test Coverage**: Good coverage but some edge cases need attention
- **Documentation**: Some docs files contain outdated or inflated claims

### Performance Concerns
- **Memory Efficiency**: Current implementation loads entire files into memory
- **Processing Speed**: No parallel processing for large datasets
- **Resource Usage**: No memory monitoring or optimization

### Architecture Improvements Needed
- **Streaming**: Implement line-by-line processing for large files
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of partial failures
- **Configuration**: More granular processing options

## 🗺️ Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Quality and Stability (Next 4 weeks)
1. **Fix Type Issues**: Resolve all mypy errors in strict mode
2. **Test Enhancement**: Add edge case coverage and integration tests
3. **Documentation Accuracy**: Update all docs to reflect actual capabilities
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and recovery strategies

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Next 8 weeks)
1. **Memory Profiling**: Implement memory usage monitoring
2. **Streaming Parser**: Develop line-by-line processing for large files
3. **Chunk Processing**: Add configurable chunk sizes for memory management
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Establish performance baselines and tests

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement (Next 12 weeks)
1. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated entry filtering capabilities
2. **Data Transformation**: Enhanced transformation and manipulation tools
3. **Integration APIs**: Better integration with LDAP servers and directories
4. **CLI Improvements**: More comprehensive command-line operations
