# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Purpose**: This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document architectural decisions made for FLEXT-LDIF. ADRs capture the context, decision, and consequences of significant architectural choices.

## ADR Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making a significant architectural decision that:

- Affects the overall system architecture
- Has long-term implications for maintainability, scalability, or performance
- Involves choosing between multiple viable alternatives
- Establishes new patterns or conventions
- Impacts external interfaces or dependencies

### ADR Template

```markdown
# [Number]: [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Context**:
[Describe the problem or situation that led to this decision]

**Decision**:
[Describe the chosen solution and rationale]

**Consequences**:
**Positive**:

- [List benefits and advantages]

**Negative**:

- [List drawbacks and risks]

**Neutral**:

- [List neutral impacts]

**Alternatives Considered**:

1. **[Alternative Name]**: [Brief description and why rejected]

**Related ADRs**:

- [Links to related decisions]

**Notes**:
[Additional context, implementation details, or follow-up items]
```

### ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Decision under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision implemented and active
- **Rejected**: Decision considered but not chosen
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR

### ADR Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially as created. The format is `ADR-XXX.md` where XXX is a zero-padded number (e.g., `ADR-001.md`, `ADR-002.md`).

## Current ADRs

## ADR Maintenance

- **Review**: ADRs should be reviewed annually or when significant changes occur
- **Updates**: Update status and add notes when decisions change
- **Links**: Maintain links between related ADRs
- **Documentation**: Reference ADRs in code comments and architecture docs
